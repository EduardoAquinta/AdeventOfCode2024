# Notes

This is my attempt at doing the Advent of Code Challenge for 2024. 
I use TDD for my work. 

## Day 1

We have 2 lists - we need to sort them into smallest to largest individually.
The calculate the difference between each list - so 1 and 3 would give 2. 
Then add up all these differences, and get the result. 

I am thinking to create a function that can do the math part, then create a function that generates the arrays via a csv file. Then use the first function with the second.
